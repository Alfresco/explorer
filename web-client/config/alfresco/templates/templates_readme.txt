Many example FreeMarker templates are present in this directory.

Most are the same as the ones available in a default installation of Alfresco in the folders:
/Company Home/Data Dictionary/Presentation Templates
/Company Home/Data Dictionary/Email Templates

More up-to-date files and obscure examples that are not appropriate for an installation may be found here.
